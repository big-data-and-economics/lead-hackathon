Read Me for the lead abatement summary excel file:

The following email came from Jacqueline regarding the LeadAbatementSummary file.

In some of the docs, youâ€™ll find links to the city GIS map and City on-line tax records, which are linked form the map if you find parcels on the map. (These are the PDFs linked in the documentation folder.)

 
Travis Mills, who knows these programs best (but does not run them currently as this position has been open for some time), provided this information. He provided here the two previous Lead grant closeout reports which have some data from the 2014 and 2017 funded grants. Travis is currently writing the report for our current grant, which concluded and a new one will sone begin. If you like, Travis can provide us with some more current numbers in the near future for the FY19 program.

A quick review for FY19 looks like we have 39 Projects that will Clear, Representing 175 housing units.

Units=apartments.

 

Travis reports: Average Lead Hazard control work cost is roughly $17,300 per unit in the FY19 program. We faced significant cost increases for structural fire-escape porch replacements.
